## Device List

### hub
 - hubitat [link](https://amzn.to/2VvqGyo)
   - better than smartthings. not reliant on cloud to work. documentation is
     lacking. better than homeassistant, though. unless detailed below, every
     device i've listed works with hubitat.

### zwave
 - zooz power strip [link](https://amzn.to/2LCTXTd)
   - monitors power usage and can be controlled per-outlet.
 - zooz 4-in-1 sensor [link](https://amzn.to/2JAV5nu)
   - the cheapest/best option for a humidity sensor that i've found. it 
     includes motion, temperature, and lux sensors, too. initially it's
     configured to blink the LED light when it detects motion. this can
     be disabled in software.
 - August Smart Lock Pro + Connect, 3rd gen [link](https://amzn.to/2VuJDBc)
   - this might work without connect, but weirdly it is cheaper when you buy
     it with connect, lately. connect gives alexa/wifi support.

### zigbee
 - ThirdReality 3RSS008Z (switch) [link](https://amzn.to/2LFRbMT)
   - perfect for controlling a light switch when you can't mess with wiring.
     i use this on non-standard lighting options as well as my bathroom fan.
 - Sylvania LIGHTIFY 4-buttons [link](https://amzn.to/2Jx1i3W)
   - can be found for $8 on sale. most buttons are closer to $30. very good
     deal, but keep in mind that it's zigbee, and zigbee buttons can take a
     while to wake up/respond when you first hit them.
 - Visonic MCT-340 E [link](https://amzn.to/30e2oaU)
     contact sensor. a bit lower profile than the smartthings.
 - SmartThings Multipurpose Sensor v4 [link](https://amzn.to/2Jx0Na4)
   - no reason to get this if v5 is in stock.
 - SmartThings Multipurpose Sensor v5 [link](https://amzn.to/30e2cbG)
   - one of the cheaper contact sensor options. includes 3-axis sensors.
 - Schlage contact sensor [link](https://amzn.to/2VkDBy6)
   - pricy contact sensor, but has terminals that you can hook up to for using
     with home projects like creating a pressure mat.
 - SamrtThings Motion Sensor [link](https://amzn.to/2LEmKXA)
   - this came with the original smartthings kit. it's okay but might as well
     get zooz 4-in-1 instead.

### wifi
 - Sonos Play:1 [link](https://amzn.to/2Yn5fMP)
   - i love this so much. but it doesn't have airplay support.
 - Nanoleaf Aurora [link](https://amzn.to/2JvifMe)
   - my fav lights. spendy, but very bright and vibrant.

### wifi, IFTTT support ONLY
 - LIFX Beam [link](https://amzn.to/2LNLNqW)
   - if you're going to have your lights exposed for effect, don't get a
     led lightstrip. get the lifx beam. it looks much nicer.
 - TP-Link Kasa HS100 (outlet) [link](https://amzn.to/2VuXgjG)
   - wifi only, works with alexa, does no power usage reporting.
 - TP-Link Kasa HS103 (outlet) [link](https://amzn.to/30dOiWW)
   - wifi only, works with alexa, does no power usage reporting.
 - Logitech Harmony [link](https://amzn.to/2JzoUox)
   - meh. it's handy to have, but if you're looking at controlling things
     like a fan or an A/C, i'd go with something else.
 - YFT Wifi Smart IR Controller [link](https://amzn.to/2Vmy1Lr)
   - i use this to control a fan in my bedroom. it can also control a TV but
     the harmony is better for multimedia/complex input devices. Uses the
	 smartlife app, which has OK IFTTT integration.
